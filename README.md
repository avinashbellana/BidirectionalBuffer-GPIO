# BIDIRECTIONAL BUFFER
This project discusses the BiDirectional Buffer and implementation of General Purpose Input Output(GPIO).GPIO circuit is implemented using MOSFETS' only and it is all Mosfets' implementation.

# SETUP FOR SIMULATION
1.Download LTspice from https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html and install LTspice simulatorXVII on your Windows system.You can download according to your operating system,here Windows 10 is used.

2.After installation Go to New schematic option on top left and draw circuit schematic using components available on top.

3.Go to Edit->Spice Directive’S’ to edit text on the schematic. Also provide input voltage as required by clicking right button and then advanced and changing input form as required. Save circuit with extension (.asc).

4.To open file which is already created,Go to File->Open(Ctrl+O) and select file with .asc extension.

5.Go to Simulate->Run to obtain waveforms.

6.You can select parameters you want to display or directly click on that part of circuit(to be displayed). 

7.SPICE NETLIST can be obtained from View->SPICE Netlist.
